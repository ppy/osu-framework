    /// A decoupling clock allows taking an existing clock which has seek limitations and provides
    /// a controllable encapsulated view of that clock with the ability to seek and track time
    /// outside of the normally seekable bounds.

    /// Put simply, it will take a Track which can only track time from 0..trackLength and allow
    /// both negative seeks and seeks beyond trackLength. It will also allow time to continue counting
    /// beyond the end of the track even when not explicitly seeked.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// There are a few things to note about this implementation:
    /// - Changing the source clock via <see cref="ChangeSource"/> will always take on the new source's running
    ///   state and current time, regardless of decoupled state.
    /// - It is always assumed that after a <see cref="Reset"/> on the source, it will be able to track time.
    /// - It is assumed that a source is generally able to start tracking from zero. Special handling ensures
    ///   that when arriving at zero from negative time, the source will attempt to be started once so it can
    ///   take over.
    ///   Note that no such special handling is assured for when the source has a maximum allowable time,
    ///   since it is not known what that time is.
