A game framework written with osu! in mind.

# Requirements

- A desktop platform which can compile .NET 4.6.1 (tested on macOS, linux and windows), using C# 7 and [.NET Core 2.0 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core).
- We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (all platforms) or [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/) 2017+ (windows only), both of which are free.

# Objectives

This framework is intended to take steps beyond what you would normally expect from a game framework. This means things like basic UI elements, text rendering, advanced input handling (textboxes) and performance overlays are provided out-of-the-box. Any of the osu! code that is deemed useful to other game projects will live in this framework project.

- Anywhere we implement graphical components, they will be displayed with a generic design and will be derivable for further customisation.
- Common elements used by games (texture caching, font loading) will be automatically initialised at runtime.
- Allow for isolated development of components via a solid testing environment (`VisualTests` and `TestCases`). Check the [wiki](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/wiki/Development-and-Testing) for more information on how these can be used to streamline development.
