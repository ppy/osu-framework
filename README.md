# osu!framework

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/fh5mnml3vsfheymp?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/peppy/osu-framework) [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/ppy/osu-framework/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/ppy/osu-framework) [![dev chat](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/188630481301012481/widget.png?style=shield)](https://discord.gg/ppy)

A game framework written with [osu!](https://github.com/ppy/osu) in mind.

## Requirements

- A desktop platform with the [.NET 5.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or higher installed.
- When running on linux, please have a system-wide ffmpeg installation available to support video decoding.
- When running on Windows 7 or 8.1, *[additional prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows?tabs=net50&pivots=os-windows#dependencies)** may be required to correctly run .NET 5 applications if your operating system is not up-to-date with the latest service packs.
- When working with the codebase, we recommend using an IDE with intellisense and syntax highlighting, such as [Visual Studio 2019+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), [Jetbrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Objectives

This framework is intended to take steps beyond what you would normally expect from a game framework. This means things like basic UI elements, text rendering, advanced input handling (textboxes) and performance overlays are provided out-of-the-box. Any of the osu! code that is deemed useful to other game projects will live in this framework project.

- Anywhere we implement graphical components, they will be displayed with a generic design and will be derivable for further customisation.
- Common elements used by games (texture caching, font loading) will be automatically initialised at runtime.
- Allow for isolated development of components via a solid testing environment (`VisualTests` and `TestCases`). Check the [wiki](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/wiki/Development-and-Testing) for more information on how these can be used to streamline development.

### Building

Build configurations for the recommended IDEs (listed above) are included. You should use the provided Build/Run functionality of your IDE to get things going. When testing or building new components, it's highly encouraged you use the `VisualTests` project/configuration. More information on this provided [below](#contributing).

- Visual Studio / Rider users should load the project via one of the platform-specific .slnf files, rather than the main .sln. This will allow access to template run configurations.

### Code analysis

Code analysis can be run with `powershell ./build.ps1` or `build.sh`. This is currently only supported under windows due to [resharper cli shortcomings](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RSRP-410004). Alternatively, you can install resharper or use rider to get inline support in your IDE of choice.

## Contributing

Contributions can be made via pull requests to this repository.

If you're unsure of what you can help with, check out the [list of open issues](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/issues) (especially those with the ["good first issue"](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label).

Before starting, please make sure you are familiar with the [development and testing](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/wiki/Development-and-Testing) procedure we have set up. New component development, and where possible, bug fixing and debugging existing components **should always be done under VisualTests**.

Note that while we already have certain standards in place, nothing is set in stone. If you have an issue with the way code is structured; with any libraries we are using; with any processes involved with contributing, *please* bring it up. We welcome all feedback so we can make contributing to this project as pain-free as possible.

For those interested, we love to reward quality contributions via [bounties](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jNXfj_S3Pb5PErA-czDdC9DUu4IgUbe1Lt8E7CYUJuE/view?&rm=minimal#gid=523803337), paid out via paypal or osu! supporter tags. Don't hesitate to [request a bounty](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSet_8iFAgPMG526pBZ2Kic6HSh7XPM3fE8xPcnWNkMzINDdYg/viewform) for your work on this project.

## Developing a game using osu!framework

If you want to get started making your own game project using osu!framework, check out our [project templates](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/tree/master/osu.Framework.Templates). You can either start off from an empty project, or take a peek at a working sample game. Either way, full project structure, cross-platform support, and testing setup are included!

## Projects that use osu!framework
